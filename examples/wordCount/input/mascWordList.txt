your
contribution
to
goodwill
will
mean
more
than
you
may
know
to
help
you
see
how
much
your
contribution
means
i
sharing
with
you
the
words
of
people
who
have
lived
goodwill
mission
we
want
you
to
know
why
your
support
of
goodwill
is
so
important
your
gift
to
goodwill
is
important
because
people
with
physical
and
mental
disabilities
sometimes
need
an
extra
hand
to
know
the
pride
that
comes
with
work
i
was
sad
when
i
couldn
go
to
the
snack
bar
to
buy
a
soda
now
i
can
buy
a
soda
and
spend
money
i
like
working
and
making
money
i
have
a
savings
account
i
can
write
my
name
on
the
deposit
slip
if
i
wasn
working
here
i
would
be
sad
maureen
because
turning
welfare
recipients
into
tax
payers
just
makes
sense
when
i
first
came
to
goodwill
i
was
a
single
parent
with
little
or
no
self
i
was
on
welfare
and
without
my
diploma
coming
to
goodwill
was
the
first
step
toward
my
becoming
totally
independent
i
am
now
totally
off
of
welfare
i
really
like
my
job
sherry
because
people
want
to
work
i
never
finished
high
school
i
had
no
experience
or
skills
the
only
thing
i
did
know
for
sure
was
here
a
chance
to
change
things
for
me
and
my
children
i
rode
a
bike
to
goodwill
in
the
rain
and
snow
i
wanted
to
be
there
i
had
my
second
chance
to
change
my
life
donna
because
teaching
a
man
to
fish
will
keep
him
fed
for
his
entire
life
before
i
got
to
goodwill
i
was
on
a
mission
i
just
wanted
a
job
it
didn
matter
what
the
job
was
i
just
wanted
one
now
i
on
a
journey
i
got
more
than
a
job
i
got
a
career
my
instructor
played
a
role
like
no
other
instructor
i
ever
had
i
appreciate
everything
that
goodwill
has
done
for
me
cornell

year

tremendous
obstacles
their
one
common
goal
they
all
want
to
work
a
robust
economy
helps
by
providing
job
opportunities
but
to
be
honest
most
of
the
people
who
aren
working
today
are
quite
simply
the
ones
who
face
the
greatest
obstacles
the
kinds
of
services
we
provide
help
people
deal
with
obstacles
like
health
care
transportation
and
child
care
problems
that
are
big
enough
on
their
own
without
being
compounded
by
factors
like
physical
and
mental
disabilities
illiteracy
and
lack
of
job
skills
last
year
goodwill
helped
people
find
jobs
that
increased
their
self
your
gift
to
goodwill
will
be
used
directly
to
support
services
that
will
help
even
more

jobs

are
thousands
of
people
who
do
not
know
what
it

support
themselves

received
a
letter

me
telling
the
success
stories
of
people
who
got
jobs
with
goodwill
help
here
another
story
of
success
from
what
might
seem
like
an
unlikely
source
goodwill
controller
juli
she
tells
me
that
the
people
we
helped
find
jobs
in
earned
approximately
million
dollars
in

them
find
jobs
goodwill

the

by
an
estimated

mental
and
physical
disabilities
after
maureen

her
how

shadow
sometimes
cast
over
people
with
physical
and
mental
disabilities
and
find
a
fulfilling
job
smack
dab
in
the
middle
of
society
remember
what
she
said
in
my
last
letter
if
i
wasn
working
here
would
be
sad
goodwill
helps
people
get
off
of
public
assistance
sherry
learned
through
our
future
works
class
that
she
could
rise
out
of
the
mire
of
the
welfare
system
and
support
her
family
at
goodwill
she
gained
in
self
in
her
vision
of
her
future
and
in
the
job
skills
she
needed
to
find
and
keep
a
good
job

goodwill
was
the

step
toward
my
becoming

report
called
goodwill
one
of
the
five
standout
good
guys
the
magazine
stated
that
goodwill
as
well
as
the
other
standouts
is
uniquely
effective
innovative
or
valuable
while
i
appreciate
u
news
world
report
endorsement
the
true
value
of
your
support
is
measured
by
the
way
goodwill
takes
on
problems
that
affect
all
of
us
every
time
we
help
someone
find
a
solution
to
their
employment
barrier
the
positive
effects
radiate
throughout
our
community
the
business
community
welcomes
not
only
another
worker
but
a
consumer
with
increased
purchasing
power
parents
act
as
role
models
of
self
instead
of
dependency
tax
dollars
that
would
have
been
spent
on
public
assistance
are
saved
you
and
i
know
that
solutions
to
difficult

is
the
hard
work
of

and
those
who
benefit
from

the
kind
of
inspiring
results
i

yourself
and
your

five
more
in
order
to
develop

skills
a

serious

in

industrial
division
it
takes
a
long
time
for
him

community
eventually
he
turns
your
support
into

dear
think
of
your
greatest
accomplishments
think
of
the
joy
and
success
they
bring
to
you
and
your
loved
ones
michael
sims
felt
that
way
at
age
the
day
he
earned
a
job
michael
was
born
with
cerebral
palsy
upon
entering
the
work
force
he
discovered
few
job
opportunities
that
seemed
to
match
his
abilities
for
several
years
he
performed
packaging
and
clerical
work
his
most
recent
job
lasted
only
a
year
before
cut
eliminated
his
position
for
long
months
michael
could
not
find
a
job
he
resorted
to
public
assistance
dollars
to
survive
finally
michael
called
goodwill
at
goodwill
michael
counselors
felt
that
his
personable
demeanor
could
be
a
major
attribute
and
identified
for
him
a
possible
job
where
his
people
skills
could
shine
after
three
interviews
michael
proved
that
he
was
the
right
person
for
the
job
as
the
clubhouse
monitor
at
bent
tree
apartments
he
now
provides
customer
service
for
to
tenants
each
night
at
last
he
has
found
success
in
a
job
that
he
loves
now
his
goals
are
set
on
moving
up
in
the
company
every
year
thousands
of
people
come
to
goodwill
like
michael
they
share
two
common
characteristics
they
face
some
barrier
to
employment
and
they
want
to
work
with
support
from
people
like
you
they
can
overcome
their
barriers
and
earn
success
and
the
self
that
comes
with
it
and
then
the
pay
begins
for
the
entire
community
individual
successes
at
goodwill
mean
fewer
persons
receiving
public
support
and
more
paying
taxes
last
year
participants
in
goodwill
programs
earned
and
paid
taxes
on
wages
of
nearly
million
their
successes
at
work
also
saved
taxpayers
more
than
three
of
a
million
dollars
in
public
assistance
the
savings
are
counted
in
more
ways
than
dollars
and
cents
however
the
families
of
the
new
wage
earners
may
feel
the
accomplishment
in
terms
of
a
house
to
live
in
money
to
purchase
food
without
food
stamps
and
the
beginning
of
a
family
focused
on
success
not
hopelessness
won
you
help
make
all
of
these
successes
possible
please
send
the
largest
contribution
you
can
comfortably
make
your
gift
will
help
give
new
meaning
to
the
word
success
for
people
who
have
seldom
had
reason
to
use
the
word
sincerely
james

p
your
gift
will
make
a
difference
for
every
dollar
of
public
support
goodwill
received
last
year
we
returned
to
the
community
in
the
form
of
earned
wages
and
reduced
public
assistance
payments
some
of
the
strongest
critics
of
our
welfare
system
are
the
people
who
have
become
dependent
on
it
their
complaint
the
system
discourages
working
because
unemployment
provides
benefits
that
many
entry
jobs
don
include
that
where
you
and
goodwill
come
in
we
help
people
train
for
and
find
jobs
that
make
it
possible
for
them
to
get
off
of
welfare
last
year
goodwill
placed
people
in
jobs
more
than
double
the
number
we
placed
in
while
the
debate
on
welfare
reform
is
gathering
like
a
storm
at
sea
the
people
who
need
jobs
are
floundering
we
need
your
support
to
continue
getting
people
off
of
public
assistance
welfare
is
not
the
answer
and
welfare
reform
is
an
uncertain
solution
with
an
unknown
starting
date
goodwill
works
right
now
please
give
the
largest
gift
you
can
to
goodwill
today

a
huge
surprise
but
i
implore
you
to
take
your
time
to
go
through
it
carefully
as
the
decision

make
will
go
off
a
long

to
determine
my
future
and
continued
existence
please
allow
me
to
introduce
myself
i

a
us
marine
sgt
in
the

battalion
th
marine
regiment
that
patrols
the
an
bar
province
iraq
i
am
desperately
in
need
of
assistance
and
i
have
summoned
up
courage
to
contact
you
i
am
presently
in
iraq
and
i
found
your
contact
particulars
in
an
address
journal
i
am
seeking
your
assistance
to
evacuate
the
sum
of
nine
hundred
thousand
us
dollars
nine
hundred
thousand
usd
in
cash
to
the
states
or
any
safe
country
as
far
as
i
can
be
assured
that
it
will
be
safe
in
your
care
until
i
complete
my
service
here
in
iraq
this
is
not
stolen
money
and
there
are
no
dangers
involved
source
of
money
some
money
in
various
currencies
was
discovered
and
concealed
in
barrels
with
piles
of
weapons
and
ammunition
at
a
location
near
one
of
saddam
hussein
old
presidential
palaces
during
a
rescue
operation
and
it
was
agreed
by
all
party
present
that
the
money
will
be
shared
among
us
click
this
link
http
this
might
appear
as
an
illegal
thing
to
do
but
i
tell
you
what
no
compensation
can
make
up
for
the
risks
we
have
taken
with
our
lives
in
this
hellhole
the
above
figure
was
given
to
me
as
my
share
and
to
conceal
this
kind
of
money
became
a
problem
for
me
so
with
the
help
of
a
british
contact
working
with
the
un
here
his
office
enjoys
some
immunity
was
able
to
get
the
package
out
to
a
safe
location
entirely
out
of
trouble
spot
he
does
not
know
the
real
contents
of
the
package
as
he
believes
that
it
belongs
to
an
american
who
died
in
an
air
raid
who
before
giving
up
trusted
me
to
hand
over
the
package
to
his
close
relative
i
have
now
found
a
secured
way
of
getting
the
package
out
of
iraq
for
you
to
pick
it
up
i
do
not
know
for
how
long
i
will
remain
here
as
i
have
been
lucky
to
survive
suicide
bomb
attacks
by
pure
divine
intervention
this
and
other
reasons
put
into
consideration
have
prompted
me
to
reach
out
for
help
if
it
might
be
of
interest
to
you
then
endeavor
to
contact
me
and
we
would
work
out
the
necessary
formalities
but
i
pray
that
you
are
discreet
about
this
mutually
benefiting
relationship
respectfully

business
offer
hello
i
am
fredrick
clifton
i
work
with
a
chemical
co
we
supply
to
the
industries
here
in
uk
a
chemical
used
for
the
purification
of
rough
diamonds
and
precious
stones
this
chemical
is
in
high
demand
here
in
uk
and
i
found
it
very
cheap
in
asia
precisely
malaysia
it
is
manufactured
in
north
korea
but
because
of
the
export
duties
in
north
korea
and
some
product
cannot
be
exported
directly
to
uk
that
is
why
we
buy
from
agents
i
need
a
middle
person
who
can
transact
the
business
with
me
the
person
will
buy
from
the
agent
in
malaysia
and
resale
to
my
company
at
the
quoted
price
if
you
are
interested
i
will
introduce
you
to
my
company
as
the
agent
dealing
on
this
chemical
in
asia
you
will
buy
from
the
agent
and
resale
to
my
company
my
company
will
be
sending
our
representative
to
asia
to
purchase
this
chemical
and
i
don
want
them
to
go
directly
to
the
agent
because
of
the
price
which
i
have
quoted
to
them
for
this
will
cause
a
conflict
of
interest
and
i
stand
the
risk
of
losing
my
job
that
is
the
more
reason
i
need
a
middle
person
in
this
transaction
person
am
supposed
to
use
as
middle
man
is
not
buoyant
this
business
is
in
this
dimension
as
you
will
not
take
my
company
representative
to
the
main
distributor
to
avoid
direct
transaction
from
the
source
since
this
is
where
we
will
be
making
our
profits
thereafter
share
the
profits
after
mapping
out
the
money
input
costs
i
don
know
if
we
can
make
this
together
as
this
is
a
long
term
and
continuous
business
if
this
is
acceptable
by
you
get
back
to
me
asap
this
is
a
personal
deal
between
you
and
i
and
i

dear
beloved
my
name
is
jennifer
wilson
i
am
a
dying
woman
who
have
decided
to
donate
what
i
have
to
you
church
organizations
i
am
years
old
and
i
was
diagnosed
with
esophageal
cancer
for
about
years
ago
immediately
after
the
death
of
my
husband
who
lived
all
his
life
in
america
who
has
left
me
everything
he
worked
for
i
have
not
particularly
lived
my
life
so
well
as
i
never
really
cared
for
anyone
though
i
am
very
rich
i
was
never
generous
i
was
always
hostile
to
people
and
only
focus
on
my
self
as
that
was
the
only
thing
i
cared
for
but
now
i
regret
all
this
as
i
now
know
that
there
is
more
to
life
than
just
wanting
to
have
or
make
all
the
money
in
the
world
i
believe
when
god
gives
me
a
second
chance
to
come
to
this
world
i
would
live
my
life
a
different
way
from
how
i
have
lived
it
now
that
i
know
my
time
is
near
i
have
been
touched
by
god
to
donate
from
what
i
have
inherited
from
my
late
husband
for
the
good
work
of
god
rather
than
allow
my
relatives
to
use
my
husband
hard
earned
funds
ungodly
so
far
i
have
distributed
money
to
some
charity
organizations
in
the
u
london
and
ireland
now
that
my
health
has
deteriorated
so
badly
i
cannot
do
this
my
self
any
more
i
once
asked
members
of
my
family
to
close
one
of
my
accounts
and
donate
the
money
which
i
have
there
to
charity
organization
in
bulgaria
they
refused
and
kept
the
money
to
themselves
hence
i
do
not
trust
them
anymore
as
they
seem
not
to
be
contended
with
what
i
have
left
for
them
the
last
of
my
money
which
is
the
huge
cash
deposit
that
i
have
with
financial
firm
in
europe
please
i
want
you
to
know
that
all
arrangement
has
been
put
in
place
with
the
finance
house
for
you
to
get
the
money
into
your
care
you
need
not
pay
any
money
upfront
for
this
project
all
that
is
expected
of
you
is
to
go
and
sign
or
endorse
the
necessary
documentation
in
your
favor
i
am
writing
this
from
my
laptop
computer
in
my
hospital
bed
where
i
wait
for
my
time
to
come
i
pray
that
god
uses
you
to
support
and
assist
me
with
good
heart
please
pray
that
the
good
lord
forgive
me
my
sins
i
have
asked
god
to
forgive
me
and
i
believe
he
has
because
he
is
a
merciful
god
i
will
be
going
in
for
an
operation
in
less
than
few
days
i
decided
to
will
the
money
to
you
for
the
good
work
of
the
lord
and
also
to
help
the
motherless
and
less
privilege
and
also
for
the
assistance
of
the
widows
according
to
james
i
took
this
decision
because
i
do
not
have
any
child
that
will
inherit
this
money
and
my
husband
relatives
are
not
inclined
to
helping
poor
persons
and
i
do
not
want
my
husband
hard
earned
money
to
be
misused
or
spent
in
the
manner
in
which
my
late
husband
did
not
specify
at
the
moment
i
cannot
take
any
telephone
calls
right
now
due
to
the
fact
that
my
relatives
are
around
my
health
status
and
me
i
wish
you
all
the
best
and
may
the
good
lord
bless
you
abundantly
and
please
use
the
funds
well
and
always
extend
the
good
work
to
others

matter
until
the
task
is
accomplished

don
want
anything
